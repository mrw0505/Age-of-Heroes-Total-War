# Age of Heroes: Total War
A Rome Total War Remastered Overhaul Mod based on the A Song of Ice and Fire (ASOIAF) Universe. The mod will maximize the features available in Rome Remastered and take creative liberty to create a gameplay experience flush with challenging emergent events in accordance to the ASOIAF lore. Pick your house and find glory!

This mod's goal is to create a more dynamic, challenging, and full-body experience. The original Rome Total war features many static factions and often turns into an all-out-attack sprint through the map. By introducing emergent factions and events, this mod will force the player to not only attack in all directions, but defend from all directions.

## Map
The strategy map will encompass all of Westeros from Dorne to Thenn beyond the wall. The map will also include the west coast of Essos and a few of the Free Cities but these will not be important to gameplay. Expansion of the map has been thought about but as you will read later, the need for more factions would scale development exponentially. Warfare between Essosi and Westerosi factions will instead be implemented through major events.\

## Factions
Factions will continue to be expanded once initial mod development has been completed. The current goal is to replace all 20 vanilla factions with ASOIAF Houses and Factions + a few additional factions. Here is the list of initial planned factions.
#### First Men Houses
- House Stark
- House Royce
- House Tully
- House Mudd
- House Lannister
- House Gardener
- House Yronwood
- House Durrandon
- House Massey
- House Greyiron
- House Greyjoy
#### Andal Houses
- House Arryn
- House Vance
- House Sevenstars
- House Lydden
- House Tyrell
- House Bar Emmon
- House Nymeros-Martell
#### Other Factions
- House Targaryen
- Triarchy
- Night's Watch
- Free Folk
  - Clans will start as part of the rebel faction

### Future Factions
Future factions will be taken into consideration based upon popularity and impact upon the ASOIAF storyline. Implementation may also be done by region of Westeros, for example focusing on the North before moving south the Vale. The number of factions possible to implement from the lore is expansive and focus will be placed on other items such as major and minor events. Implementation of certain houses may be through random events. For example, House Manderly may be a random event for House Stark when a son "comes of age" as an adopted Manderly. This way, we can include House Manderly's salvation by the Starks rather than introducing them as a faction the Starks must destroy to solidify the North.

## Events
### Major Events
#### Coming of the Andals
The Andal invasion will be the first major event encountered by the player. It will begin on turn 20 (subject to change) allowing the player to establish a foothold in their territory. Utilizing the horde mechanics of Rome Total War: Barbarian Invasion, individual Andal Houses will begin to appear all over the continent of Westeros in search of a new home. Andal Houses will include: House Lydden (The Westerlands), House Vance (The Riverlands), House Arryn (The Vale), House Bar Emmon (The Stormlands), House Sevenstar (The North), House Nymeros-Martell (Dorne), House Tyrell (The Reach) and more as time allows for expansion beyond the main invaders.

#### Targaryen Conquest
The Targaryen Conquest will be the second major event occurred by the player on turn 40 (subject to change), allowing the player to make significant headway into their conquest. Landing with the Conqueror at King's Landing and the Baratheons in the Stormlands, the Targaryens will look to immediately find their foothold in eastern Westeros. While dragons are not in the scope of the current mod plan, the Targaryens will still be a major player.

#### Triarchy Invasion of the Stepstones
After putting down the Targaryen Conquest, the player must now face Essosi incursions. This event will occur at turn 60 (subject to change). Led by a triple alliance of Lys, Tyrosh, and Myr, invasion forces will land in eastern Dorne to lay claim to Westerosi soil.

#### The Long Night
The Long Night will be the end game that appears out of the far North on turn 80 (subject to change), allowing the player time to solidify their hold over all of Westeros. The Long Night will consist of hordes of undead that will be almost impossible to stop. The player must concentrate their entire military forces to stop them.

### Minor Events
#### King-Beyond-the-Wall
If the player has not chosen a Free Folk/Wilding faction, a King-Beyond-the-Wall will appear at the Wall in the North in a random turn after turn 10. The King-Beyond-the-Wall will pose a threat to the Night's Watch and Northern factions. Implementation for more Kings Beyond the Wall will be considered after full implementation of the initial mod to better reflect the multiple occurrences in ASOIAF lore.

#### Nymeria's War
The Warrior Queen Nymeria has arrived on the shores of Dorne years after the Coming of the Andals. Marrying into the Martell family, House Nymeros-Martell now stands as the most powerful house in Dorne. The player must fend off the foreign invaders to secure their rule over the kingdom.

## Faction Unique Gameplay Mechanics
### Night's Watch Gameplay
The Night's Watch settlements will always have the minimum population, meaning they cannot recruit units traditionally. Instead the player must use a custom mercenary pool only available to the Night's Watch Faction to find new Recruits. With these recruits, the player can disperse them into their settlements population to allow for unit recruitment. These recruits alone cost the player nothing to hire or upkeep. However, to train them into soldiers the player must spend money on their equipment and arms. To upkeep their military might and survive, the player must rely on minimal trade, bare infrastructure, and strong tactics. Horses are few on the wall, so the only available cavalry are your general's bodyguards. As the Night's Watch is not an organized army, their units will be much smaller in size to represent their lack of ambition and threat to the Southern Kingdoms they protect.
#### Night's Watch Units
- Rangers
  - Line Infantry
- Builders
  - Shock Infantry
- Stewards
  - Crossbowmen
- Recruits
  - Levy equivalent

### Free Folk Gameplay
The Free Folk, or Wildings, will represent an interesting challenge as they are split into multiple Factions representing the different clans told in lore. Each clan however, will not be a final product like the southron factions as their unit rosters will be incomplete. The player must "unite" the Free Folk clans in order to achieve a complete unit roster and take on the Night's Watch and Southern Kingdoms. Settlements will function similarly to the Night's Watch however, they will instead have a starting population pool that the player has available to them. Also similar to the Night's Watch, the Free Folks only access to cavalry will be through their general units, though cavalry may be scrapped entirely from their roster in the future. Free folk units will often be high in troop count but low on defense to represent their tribal cultures. A true win by numbers gameplay experience.
#### Free Folk Clans
All clans will have the generic free folk unit available to them composed of axemen, swordsmen, and spearmen utilizing the Rome Remastered feature allowing multiple unit models per unit.
- **Thenns**
  - Trained Shock Infantry
  - Trained Spearmen
- **Hornfoots**
  - Spearmen
- **Night Runners**
  - Archers
- **Ice River Clans**
  - Skirmishers
- **Men of the Frozen Shore**
  - Dog Chariots
- **Cave Dwellers**
  - Berserkers
- **Giants**
  - Mammoths
  - Giants
